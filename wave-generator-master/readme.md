# A simple wave generator written in Python 3

This is a wave generator that can generate sine, sawtooth, triangle and square waves.
Using command line parameters, you can modify the wave type, the frequency and the play time.
The output file is an uncompressed, 16bit format, wave file (.wav) that can be played by any audio player.

## Usage:
python wavegenerator.py (WAVEFORM) (FREQUENCY) (PLAYTIME) (FILENAME).wav

> python wave_generator.py sine 78 5 example.wav  
< File 'example.wav' created!  
< Wave Type: sine  
< Frequency: 78hz  
< Play Time: 5 seconds
